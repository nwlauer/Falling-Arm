# Falling-Arm

Purpose: The falling arm project came up in discussion with other members of heat synch labs in making a manaquine as creepy as possible. The general idea was to have the manaiqune arm fall off on command through some trigger(button press or other defined event) and then after a set period of time the arm would "reload" and retact itself back on the mannaquienn

First Design: 
The original design I came up with involved a solenoid holding the arm in position with some sort of joint that limitied orientation to ensure that it would reattach in the proper postion. To retract the arm a simple motor pulley and string would be used.





End Design:
